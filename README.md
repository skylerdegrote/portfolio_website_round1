## Featuring Skyler DeGrote's design and development portfolio pieces
My Design portfolio is mainly from my four year degree in advertising and graphic communications. I have worked on it since, however.
The most recent piece is the Scooby Doo Illustrations, inspired by the Scooby doo Cartoons.
My Development portfolio is mainly from my time at Prime Digital Academy. Prime is an 18 week accelerated program for software engineering.
I graduated with 20 other people on October 2, 2015. From this experience I have skills in the full MEAN stack of development languages.
