# Skyler's portfolio website
#### Featuring design and development portfolio pieces
My Design portfolio is mainly from my four year degree in advertising and graphic communications. I have worked on it since, however.
The most recent piece is the Scooby Doo Illustrations, inspired by the Scooby doo Cartoons.
My Development portfolio is mainly from my time at Prime Digital Academy. Prime is an 18 week accelerated program for software engineering.
I graduated with 20 other people on October 2, 2015. From this experience I have skills in the full MEAN stack of development languages.

## My Time at Prime Digital Academy
I enjoyed every moment I spent at Prime Digital Academy. The environment and the atmosphere was very welcoming and supportive. The people, including both
students and staff members, were a great group to be around every day.
<br><br>
I also learned a lot at Prime. Not only in Software Engineering languages, but also in public speaking and teamwork. At the beginning of the program I would
get so nervous speaking in front of a the small group of 20 people. Mid-way through I gave an icebreaker speech voluntarily at Toastmasters. At the end of the
program, not only did I speak in front of a giant group for my Client Project Presentation, but I also voluntarily spoke at Graduation on October 2, 2015.
I also learned how I work with teams and how to interact with different personality types.
<br><br>
Prime let me accomplish a lot throughout the program. I feel confident in my presentation and public speaking skills as well as in my coding skills for the MEAN
stack development languages. I've been continuing the learning process via [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/) and other resources given to me by Prime. I plan
to learn as much as I can while searching for a career in Software Engineering.
