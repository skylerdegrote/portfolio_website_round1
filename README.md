## Featuring Skyler DeGrote's design and development portfolio pieces
My Design portfolio is mainly from my four year degree in advertising and graphic communications. I have worked on it since, however.
My Development portfolio is mainly from my time at Prime Digital Academy. Prime is an 18 week accelerated program for software engineering.
I graduated with 20 other people on October 2, 2015. From this experience I have skills in the full MEAN stack of development languages.
