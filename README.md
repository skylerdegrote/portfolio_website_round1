# Skyler's portfolio website
#### Featuring design and development portfolio pieces
My Design portfolio is mainly from my four year degree in advertising and graphic communications. I have worked on it since, however.
The most recent piece is the Scooby Doo Illustrations, inspired by the Scooby doo Cartoons.
My Development portfolio is mainly from my time at Prime Digital Academy. Prime is an 18 week accelerated program for software engineering.
I graduated with 20 other people on October 2, 2015. From this experience I have skills in the full MEAN stack of development languages.

## On the Resume Page
I've included everything from how to contact me to what my extra curricular activities in college were. The pieces that I believe are the
most important are
1. What my experience was like at Prime Digital Academy
2. What I am looking for in a career
3. My software knowledge
4. How to contact me

All of the graphics on this page were created by me as well in Adobe Illustrator CC.
### The work experience in detail
I wanted to create a clean look for my website, so I didn't include any of the details pertaining to my work experience.
