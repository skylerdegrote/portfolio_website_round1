# Skyler's portfolio website
#### Featuring design and development portfolio pieces
My Design portfolio is mainly from my four year degree in advertising and graphic communications. I have worked on it since, however.
The most recent piece is the Scooby Doo Illustrations, inspired by the Scooby doo Cartoons.
<br><br>
My Development portfolio is mainly from my time at Prime Digital Academy. Prime is an 18 week accelerated program for software engineering.
I graduated with 20 other people on October 2, 2015. From this experience I have skills in the full MEAN stack of development languages.

## My Time at Prime Digital Academy
I enjoyed every moment I spent at Prime Digital Academy. The environment and the atmosphere was very welcoming and supportive. The people, including both
students and staff members, were a great group to be around every day.
<br><br>
I also learned a lot at Prime. Not only in Software Engineering languages, but also in public speaking and teamwork. At the beginning of the program I would
get so nervous speaking in front of a the small group of 20 people. Mid-way through I gave an icebreaker speech voluntarily at Toastmasters. At the end of the
program, not only did I speak in front of a giant group for my Client Project Presentation, but I also voluntarily spoke at Graduation on October 2, 2015.
I also learned how I work with teams and how to interact with different personality types.
<br><br>
Prime let me accomplish a lot throughout the program. I feel confident in my presentation and public speaking skills as well as in my coding skills for the MEAN
stack development languages. I've been continuing the learning process via [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/) and other resources given to me by Prime. I plan
to learn as much as I can while searching for a career in Software Engineering.

## What I'm looking for
I'm looking for a career with a company that allows and encourages growth and learning as developer. I am looking for the culture of
collaboration and the need to learn from coworkers. I love learning and I love working on a team. So a company that can give me both
of those would be the ideal company for me to work at.
